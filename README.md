# Low-Code-eAI-with-MATLAB-ARM-IPX

The intersection of AI and embedded systems represents a frontier of technological innovation. With the exponential
growth in IoT devices and the advancement of AI models, there is a pressing need for professionals who can effectively deploy AI
in resource-constrained environments. The goal of this tutorial is to present a low-code end-to-end workflow in an interactive
hands-on format. 

The tutorial focuses on design, optimization, and deployment of AI algorithms on Arm processors, typically used in powerconscious
embedded devices. Using MATLAB, participants will learn to start from a high-level algorithmic design, optimize
it, and auto-generate optimized C code. Arm IP Explorer complements this by offering the detailed insights into the
performance metrics. This synergy allows for easy fine-tuning of applications to achieve performant solutions using reliable
benchmarks.

The tutorial will engage in practical exercises, such as applying the end-to-end MATLAB workflow on curated dataset and collecting cycle-accurate runtime metrics from simulations in the Arm IP Explorer

Hardware and Software Requirements
To participate in the workshop, you need: 
1.	A laptop
2.	Google Chrome browser
3.	A MathWorks account
4.  Arm account

You will be provided with a temporary MATLAB workshop license that will give you access to all products used in the workshop, as well as the workshop exercise files. Access to Arm account is public and free.

If you donâ€™t have an Arm account, you need to create one to get access to Arm IP Explorer and use the material for this event. You will need access to your email on the machine you are using to create the account. Navigate to this address in Google Chrome: https://ipexplorer.arm.com/login and click Register to register for an Arm account. 

Congratulations! You are all set up to join us on the hands-on workshop! Have fun!
