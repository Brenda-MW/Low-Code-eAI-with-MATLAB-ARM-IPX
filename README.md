# Low-Code-eAI-with-MATLAB-ARM-IPX

The intersection of AI and embedded systems represents a frontier of technological innovation. With the exponential
growth in IoT devices and the advancement of AI models, there is a pressing need for professionals who can effectively deploy AI
in resource-constrained environments. The goal of this tutorial is to present a low-code end-to-end workflow in an interactive
hands-on format. 

The tutorial focuses on design, optimization, and deployment of AI algorithms on Arm processors, typically used in powerconscious
embedded devices. Using MATLAB, participants will learn to start from a high-level algorithmic design, optimize
it, and auto-generate optimized C code. Arm IP Explorer complements this by offering the detailed insights into the
performance metrics. This synergy allows for easy fine-tuning of applications to achieve performant solutions using reliable
benchmarks.

The tutorial will engage in practical exercises, such as applying the end-to-end MATLAB workflow on curated dataset and collecting cycle-accurate runtime metrics from simulations in the Arm IP Explorer
